The Game of Life was founded on September 13, 1999.

The Game of Life aims to organize projects in the field of spatial representation in electronic music.

With our programming we bring a diversity of high quality electronic music into the limelight.

We offer composers (in the broadest sense of the word) the opportunity to work with our mobile Wave Field Synthesis playback system (the only mobile WFS system in the world). In doing so, we offer listeners an experience that cannot be enjoyed with current surround sound systems at home.

We are closely involved in the process of creation, production and programming and help venues with audience development where possible.

__How it began__

The foundation's name comes from a project by Arthur Sauer that was organized by Erwin Roebroeks.

For this project, an eight-channel 3D sound system was designed and an inflatable, igloo-shaped tent was built. This made it possible to perform at a wide variety of venues. Therefore, the motto was "the stage comes to you. Because of its appearance, the mobile stage was very approachable, which led to a diverse (multicultural) audience.

The next step was to build our own, mobile WFS system.

__Wave Field Synthesis (WFS)__

With our special WFS system, a unique acoustic environment can be created. Because the system is mobile and flexible, it can be set up anywhere.

In 2004 we traveled with a number of composers to the Fraunhofer Institute in Ilmenau to listen to WFS. Everyone was convinced that the system worked. But we were also convinced that it could be done better and cheaper. So we decided to build a WFS system ourselves. Wouter Snoei developed the software, architect Raviv Ganchrow designed and built the speakers, and Jan Tr√ºtzschler programmed the synchronization of the computers with each other. We were given access to TU Delft's dead space, including technical assistance. After measurements by the TU, our system proved to meet all quality requirements. Because the software is open source, anyone can modify it at will. Students at the Institute of Sonology are currently programming new features for the system.

November 2006 saw the premiere of the first concert in the series "THE 192 Loudspeaker Experience (Focussed Sound in Sonic Space). Due to great public interest, concerts had to be continuously scheduled.

In the meantime, there has been much interest from composers, programmers and other institutions in working with the WFS system.
