We have received fantastic news that the Konrad Boehmer Foundation will be providing us with financial support. This will enable us to carry out maintenance and modernization on our WFS system. In addition to repairing humming amplifiers, fixing broken subwoofers, and replacing worn cables, we will be upgrading our audio connections to utilize the Dante protocol. This upgrade will lead to a more stable and simplified setup. 

This transformation will allow us to operate the entire system from a single computer, eliminating the need for the current two-computer setup that necessitates intricate synchronization. Utilizing a single computer will result in reduced latency and is poised to open up new avenues for     acoustic and musical experiments involving live input and control.

Of course, we thank the Konrad Boehmer Foundation for their support!
