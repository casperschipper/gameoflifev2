We have just received the wonderful news that Konrad Boehmer Foundation will support us financially maintenance and modernisation of our WFS system. Apart from repairing humming amplifiers, fixing broken subwoofers and replacing worn cables, we will move the system to a Dante based protocol, which will make the system more stable and even quicker to setup. Moving to Dante will also remove the need to run the system on multiple computers, which will reduce latency and should open a whole new area of experiments and musical possibility to explore.

Of course, we thank Konrad Boehmer Foundation for their support!
