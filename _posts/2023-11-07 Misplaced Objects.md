We were invited as a guest to Anahit Hovhannisyan "Misplaced Objects" radio show at Echobox Radio to talk about Wave Field Synthesis, composing spatial music and the Game of Life Foundation. It was a really fun conversation and you can listen back to it on soundcloud below. It also includes a few binaural recordings of music played on WFS, so be sure to listen with headphones.
