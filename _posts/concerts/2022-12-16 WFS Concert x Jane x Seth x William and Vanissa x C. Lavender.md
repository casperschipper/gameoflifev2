# Artists:

Jane Balfus

Jane Balfus is an American artist.  Her multi-media installations focus on storytelling, using surveillance, consecration and found objects as a means to exalt and preserve the ordinary. Her pieces memorialize isolated or splintered moments--mundane, naive, or exceptional, and always in the presence of quiet beauty.
